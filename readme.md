# Notepad

This is my part of a bigger project, which I developed during my studies at Warsaw University of Technology. Here I share only my part of this project, which is the client app for collab notepad.

This was originally written in a client-server architecture, but because I share here only my part, I made a couple of changes for my client app, and it can run now as a server. So now it's more like a peer-to-peer connection. Only one client and one server can run at once. I did it only for you to look, how it works.

Please visit [my website](www.mmakos.pl/programming/notepad) to learn more about this project, and to see other things I do.
